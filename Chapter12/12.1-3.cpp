/**

 * 12.1-3
 * Give a nonrecursive algorithm that performs an inorder tree walk. (Hint: An easy
 * solution uses a stack as an auxiliary data structure. A more complicated, but elegant, solution uses no stack but assumes that you can test two pointers for equality.)
 *
 * R: Already in the file BinaryTree.cpp
