 * Argue that since sorting n elements takes Ω(nlgn) time in the worst case in the comparison model,
 * any comparison-based algorithm for constructing a binary search tree
 * from an arbitrary list of n elements takes Ω(nlgn) time in the worst case.
 *
 * R: The algorithm for the insertion of N elements would take at least a time of Ω(nlgn) because of the nature
 * of a binary tree, that needs it's elements to be sorted while it's being built.
