 * Prove that no matter what node you start at in a height-h binary search tree, k
 * successive calls to TREE-SUCCESSOR take O(k+h) time.
 *
 * R: If a tree-successor function takes O(h) in the worst case, where h is the height of a tree, the total execution time
 * for a tree-sucessor function that is called K times is O(k) + O(h), or O(k+h);
