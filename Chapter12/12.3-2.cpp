 * Suppose that you construct a binary search tree by repeatedly inserting distinct
 * values into the tree. Argue that the number of nodes examined in searching for a
 * value in the tree is 1 plus the number of nodes examined when the value was first
 * inserted into the tree.
 *
 * R: For searching the number of comparisons will be plus one because we have to compare the value that is being searched. For both,
 * we use the same method of searching, the binary search.
