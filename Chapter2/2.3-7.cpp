 * 2.3-7
 * The while loop of lines 537 of the INSERTION-SORT procedure in Section 2.1
 * uses a linear search to scan (backward) through the sorted subarray AŒ1 W j  1�.
 * What if insertion sort used a binary search (see Exercise 2.3-6) instead of a linear
 * search? Would that improve the overall worst-case running time of insertion sort
 * to n lg n?
