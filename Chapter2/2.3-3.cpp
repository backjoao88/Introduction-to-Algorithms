 * 2.3-3
 * State a loop invariant for the while loop of lines 12 and 18 of the MERGE procedure.
 * Show how to use it, along with the while loops of lines 20 and 23 and 24 and 27, to prove
 * that the MERGE procedure is correct.
 *
 * Loop Invariant: The A array, consisted of A[start..end] must have the smallest elements (in order);
 * This loop invariant is defined for the two loops performed after.
