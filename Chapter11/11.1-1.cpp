 * 11.1-1
 * Suppose that a dynamic set is represented by a direct-address table of length m. Describe a procedure that finds the maximum element of S.
 * What is the worst-case performance of your procedure?
 *
 * R: To traverse a dynamic set we need to pass each node individually, and in the worst case we would be traversing all the list,
 * so the growth would be O(m).
