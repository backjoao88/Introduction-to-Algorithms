 * You wish to search a linked list of length n, where each element contains a key
 * k along with a hash value h(k). Each key is a long character string. How might
 * you take advantage of the hash values when searching the list for an element with
 * a given key?
 *
 * R: Iterating over the list and checking if the generated hash value is equal to the current key. If is then compare the string content
 * until find the correct one.
