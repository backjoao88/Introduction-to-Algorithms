 * Suggest how to allocate and deallocate storage for elements within the hash table
 * itself by creating a (free list) a linked list of all the unused slots. Assume that
 * one slot can store a flag and either one element plus a pointer or two pointers. All
 * dictionary and free-list operations should run in O.1/ expected time. Does the free
 * list need to be doubly linked, or does a singly linked free list suffice?
