 * Professor Marley hypothesizes that he can obtain substantial performance gains by
 * modifying the chaining scheme to keep each list in sorted order. How does the professorâ€™s modification
 * affect the running time for successful searches, unsuccessful
 * searches, insertions, and deletions?
 *
 * R: For insertion and deletion, it would depend of the sorting algorithm: Sort + O(1). Considering a Sort
 * algorithm of O(m) then it would take O(1) + O(m)
